- What is in a class?
    > A class typically contains fields, constructors and methods, which together define the data and behavior of objects created from the class.
- What are fields?
    > Fields are variables declared within a class to store data.
- What is a constructor?
    > A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects of a class.
- What is a method?
    > A method is a function defined within a class to perform actions or computations.
- What do we write when we do not return anything from a method?
    > We write void as the return type.
- What is an object?
    > An object is an instance of a class.
- What is a static method?
    > A static method belongs to the class itself rather than any specific object instance. You do not need to create an instance of the class in order to be able to use the method.
