### Summary  
In this next part of recursion, you’ll explore how problems can solve themselves — literally.\
By learning to “think recursively,” you’ll write methods that call themselves to break large problems into smaller, more manageable parts.

You’ll start with some mathematical examples like summing numbers. While these are typically and more easily done with regular loops, these assignments build your intuition for spotting recursive patterns and teaches you how to define both the base case and the recursive step.\
Then you'll move on to recursion with arrays, which form the basis of some algorithms you'll write in the next year's course **Algorithms**.
