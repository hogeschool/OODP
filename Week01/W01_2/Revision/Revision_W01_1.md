* What C# types did we look at? 
* What is the result of this: `var doMath = 10 / 4;`, and why? 
* How do you print something to the console?
* How do you read something in from the console?
* How could you improve the condition in the following code?
```
int num = 5;
bool isEven = num % 2 ==0;
if (isEven == true)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Even");
}
```
* Why does this result in an error?
```
int num = 3;
if (num < 1)
{
    int ans = 5;
}
Console.WriteLine(ans);
```
* What is a `switch` statement?
* What is a `switch` expression?
* When should you use a `switch` vs an `if` statement?
