### Summary  
Weeks 14 and 15 focus on one central topic: **recursion**.
Recursion is a special kind of loop â€” a method that calls itself. For certain problems, recursion can be a more elegant or even simpler alternative to regular loops (`for`, `while`, etc.).

We will explore recursion through two related data structures: **linked lists** and **trees**. Both consist of `Node` objects that connect to each other, forming structures that can grow dynamically.

A **linked list** connects each node to exactly one next node, forming a simple chain.\
A **tree**, on the other hand, allows each node to connect to multiple other nodes, creating a branching structure.
