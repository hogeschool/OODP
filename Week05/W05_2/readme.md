# Week 05

## Day 1 (W05_2)

### Contents: interfaces
* Implementing (W05.2.1T01)
* Implementing multiple interfaces (W05.2.1T02) <- You can't do this with inheritance
* Interfaces with properties (W05.2.1T03)
* Interface objects (W05.2.1T04) <- Here it gets interesting
* Interface inheritance (W05.2.1T05)
* Classes with interface as members (W05.2.1T06)
* Derived class that implements an interface

### But WHY use interfaces?
HIGHLY recommended watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sxyDXt1igs

Inheritance forces you in a tree-like structure. For example:
```
           Machine
          /       \
 CopyingMachine  NetworkRouter
```

Interfaces let you say: "_Any class that promises to implement this interface will provide this functionality._"

For example:

```csharp
public interface IAuthenticate
{
    void Login(string password);
}
```

Now both `CopyingMachine` and `NetworkRouter` can implement it:

```csharp
public class CopyingMachine : Machine, IAuthenticate { ... }
public class NetworkRouter : Machine, IAuthenticate { ... }
```

And now you pass objects of both these classes to this method:
```csharp
public static void LoginService(IAuthenticate authenticator)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Please provide your password:");
    string providedPassword = Console.ReadLine();
    authenticator.Login(providedPassword);
}

CopyingMachine cm = new();
NetworkRouter nr = new();
LoginService(cm);
LoginService(nr);
```

Instead of being forced into one tree, interfaces let you connect classes across different branches. Itâ€™s more like a web than a tree.

-> **interfaces are about what something _has_ or _can_**
